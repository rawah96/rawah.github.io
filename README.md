This is a draft of my personal portfolio project for full stack web development course. 
It consists of a front page with a slide show for visitors to select where they want to be directed;
There are three pages in which they can choose from; about me, projects i've worked on in the past, and contact me page.
There are many things I am planning to change and features that I am planning to add in the future.
The languages I used for this project is HTML, CSS, and javascript.
